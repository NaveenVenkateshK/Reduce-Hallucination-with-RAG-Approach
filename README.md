# Reduce-Hallucination-with-RAG-Approach
Introducing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, a game-changer in reducing hallucinations and improving the accuracy of information.

# 🤖 What is RAG?
RAG seamlessly combines the power of language generation models with retrieval mechanisms. It doesn't just generate responses; it fetches information from reliable sources to ensure your AI assistant delivers spot-on answers.

# 🌈 Dive into the World of Hallucination Reduction
Our journey begins with a language model, and in this case, we're using the cutting-edge "TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML." 🚀✨ By leveraging Google Search API, we retrieve real-time content to provide responses that are not just accurate but also contextually rich.

# 🧐 Example Scenario: Impact of Ms Dhoni’s Moon Landing
Imagine asking about the impact of Ms Dhoni’s moon landing. 🚀🌕 The RAG approach doesn't just rely on pre-programmed responses; it analyzes real-world data to craft responses that are as informative as they are relevant.

# 💡 Why RAG Matters?
**Accuracy:** RAG minimizes the chances of hallucinations by cross-verifying information.
**Relevance:** Responses are tailored to the latest information available.
**Dynamic Learning:** The system evolves as it learns from real-time data.
